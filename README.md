# JavaScript-CP-Templates

A curated collection of efficient JavaScript templates and utilities for competitive programming. These templates are designed to speed up your workflow in online contests by providing reusable code snippets for common algorithms, data structures, and I/O operations.

## Description

JavaScript-CP-Templates is a repository aimed at competitive programmers who prefer using JavaScript for contests like Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, and others. The repository provides minimal yet highly optimized code snippets that help tackle frequently recurrent problems and patterns in competitive programmingâ€”from fast input/output handling to graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.

## Features

- Ready-to-use snippets for most popular algorithms and data structures
- Consistent JavaScript syntax, suitable across major online judges
- Focus on speed, efficiency, and reducing lines of code during contests
- Clean separation of topics: arrays, strings, graphs, math, dynamic programming, etc.
