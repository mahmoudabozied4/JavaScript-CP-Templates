## 🎯 About

JavaScript-CP-Templates is built for competitive programmers who use JavaScript in contests like **Codeforces**, **AtCoder**, **LeetCode**, and more. This repository provides minimal yet highly optimized code snippets designed to tackle frequently recurring problems—from fast I/O handling to graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and beyond.

Stop rewriting the same code in every contest. Copy, adapt, and solve faster.

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Contest-Ready** - Optimized snippets that work across major online judges
- **📦 Comprehensive Library** - Covers algorithms, data structures, and utilities
- **🚀 Performance-Focused** - Written for speed and minimal memory usage
- **📚 Well-Organized** - Clean separation by topics for quick navigation
- **🔧 Plug & Play** - Copy-paste directly into your solution with minimal modification

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JavaScript-CP-Templates.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd JavaScript-CP-Templates
```

### Usage

1. Browse the organized folders to find the algorithm or data structure you need
2. Copy the template into your contest solution file
3. Adapt the code to your specific problem
4. Submit and conquer! 🏆

**Example:**

```javascript
// Import fast I/O for Node.js contests
const fastIO = require('./utils/fastIO');
